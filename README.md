Created as a project on **hyperskill.org**

## Calculator supports:
- addition "+"
- subtraction "-"
- multiplication "*"
- division "/"
- reading and creating variables
- using variables in expressions
- using brackets to change order of operations

### Syntax:
Every number and operator should be separated by one space.  
2 + 3 - 1 # good  
2 + 1 - (5 * 2) # good - parenthesis don't need to be separated  
a=2 # wrong - assign operator should be separated 

### Known issues:
Calculator doesn't support multi-bracket expressions.
